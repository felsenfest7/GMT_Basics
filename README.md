# GMT BASICS FOR GEOMATICS ENGINEERING

GMT is open-source software that provides command-line tools for working with geographic and cartesian data. It offers features like data manipulation, map projection support, data visualization, and the creation of high-quality maps and illustrations. GMT includes geospatial data, supports various map projections, and allows for customization. It is widely used in scientific and geographic applications.

GMT can be utilized across various programs or programming languages, including Python, MATLAB, Octave, Julia, and via the terminal using its original syntax rules. Thanks to GMT, it becomes possible to visualize a wide range of data types such as grids, netCDF4, and point data. GMT finds extensive applications in geomatics engineering, particularly in geodesy, due to its support for different projection types and its simplicity in visualizing spatial data.
