# GMT BASICS FOR GEOMATICS ENGINEERING

Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is open-source software that provides command-line tools for working with geographic and cartesian data. It offers features like data manipulation, map projection support, data visualization, and the creation of high-quality maps and illustrations. GMT includes geospatial data, supports various map projections, and allows for customization. It is widely used in scientific and geographic applications.

GMT can be utilized across various programs or programming languages, including Python, MATLAB, Octave, Julia, and via the terminal using its original syntax rules. Thanks to GMT, it becomes possible to visualize a wide range of data types such as grids, netCDF4, and point data. GMT finds extensive applications in geomatics engineering, particularly in geodesy, due to its support for different projection types and its simplicity in visualizing spatial data.

## GMT SYNTAX

GMT has a different and complex syntax in terms of other programming languages such as Python or C#; because. In order to use GMT on Linux, first of all a shell (.sh) file have to be created, and afterwards that file should be started with #!bin/bash comment in order to specifiy which shell a .sh script will be executed with and ensures the script's portability and executability in a broader context. So the heading a shell file should be seen like below.
